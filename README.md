# JPEG Backer Upper

Command line utility designed to copy all files ending in '.jpg' from one file into another, preserving directory structure. I use this tool to backup pictures I've taken into google photos as google photos will not backup the .ARW files my camera uses to store raw images. 

## Usage

```
py backupJPEGs.py 'C:/Users/Desktop/rawFromCamera' 'C:/Users/Desktop/New Folder'

```
